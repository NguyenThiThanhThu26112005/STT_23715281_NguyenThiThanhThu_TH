                        Scrapbook albums have existed since the  beginning of photography. However, the sad  fact is that photographs and most printed  material are not permanent; they will fade and  
                        yellow with age. Scrapbookers of today are  aware of these problems, and the industry is  providing remedies to minimize deterioration.  For the best results, avoid using materials with  high acid content which can cause photos and  
                        paper to deteriorate. Another thing to avoid is  ignin, a material that is the bonding element in  Wood fibers. Over time, paper with lignin will become yellow and brittle, so you should  
                        only use lignin-free products.

                        Your albums should contain page protectors to shield the pages from smudges, oil, and  dirt that can be transferred from your hands. You should never use albums with sticky  
                        "magnetic" pages. The sticky substance will be transferred to the photo and backing paper,  causing deterioration. Never crop Polaroid® photos; they will curl and fall apart. Mount  
                        all memorabilia on acid-free cardstock paper, and photocopy all newspaper clippings on  acid-free paper.
